## 👋 Hi, I'm Uttam

### I love Go routines
I’ve been working with SQL, exploring Docker, and having a blast with my new favorite language — Go 🐹, followed closely by C and Python.

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into how servers and web applications are implemented in Go, and I’m loving every bit of it.

I’m eager to apply my skills and the technologies I’ve learned and am constantly exploring the rabbit hole of tech.
If I can get my hands dirty, I'm all in!
